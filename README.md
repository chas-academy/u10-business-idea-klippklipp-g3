# Product description
We have all been through the painful process of experimenting with different hairdressers and have not been satisfied. But then all of sudden, you meet that hairdresser who does the little extra and you feel like a million bucks. To then next time you come around the same salon get the devastating news that your favorite hairdresser is nowhere to be found. 

This app solves this problem.

*  You can find your hairdresser regardless of salon
*  You can rate your hairdresser and take part in other people's ratings
*  You can specify hairdresser based on area

# Group policy and work ethics

All group members are expected to attend stand-ups (as of now, Mondays @ 1 PM) and other meetings assigned by the group as a whole.

This being said we are all people with personal lives and unexpected things can happen. If for whatever reason any team member can not attend a meeting or is in risk of missing a deadline it is important that you take personal responsibility and contact the group in the designated slack group channel.

Other than that, happy hacking ðŸ¤©

## Product Backlog

Not every item on the backlog is ready to work on. An item can be place in the backlog even if it never gets used.

If a backlog item description is unclear, you can add clearification request to the author asking to clearlify the item by adding `---`, e.g:

```
Add option for user to do some stuff.

---

Which user should be able to do what?
```
