# Product description

We've all been there! You toggle between hairdstylists without ever being really satisfied. Then one day, you find a stylist... a stylist that gets your unique style and makes you feel like a million bucks. Of course, eventually such a great stylist will probably move on and now your back in the rabbit hole, trying to find that one stylist that just gets you.

This is the problem we solve:

- You and your stylist(s) can keep in touch regardless of where they work
- You can rate your stylist(s) and see other peoples ratings
- You can search for stylists using location

# Group policy and work ethics

All group members are expected to attend stand-ups (as of now, Mondays @ 1 PM) and other meetings assigned by the group as a whole.

This being said we are all people with personal lives and unexpected things can happen. If for whatever reason any team member can not attend a meeting or is in risk of missing a deadline it is important that you take personal responsibility and contact the group in the designated slack group channel.

Other than that, happy hacking ðŸ¤©

## Product Backlog

Not every item on the backlog is ready to work on. An item can be place in the backlog even if it never gets used.

If a backlog item description is unclear, you can add clearification request to the author asking to clearlify the item by adding `---`, e.g:

```
Add option for user to do some stuff.

---

Which user should be able to do what?
```
