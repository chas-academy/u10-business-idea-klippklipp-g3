# Group policy and work ethics

All group members are expected to attend stand-ups (as of now, Mondays @ 1 PM) and other meetings assigned by the group as a whole.

This being said we are all people with personal lives and unexpected things can happen. If for whatever reason any team member can not attend a meeting or is in risk of missing a deadline it is important that you take personal responsibility and contact the group in the designated slack group channel.

Other than that, happy hacking ðŸ¤©

# Stacks

**Frontend:** [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)

**Backend:** [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Envirnoment and setup

We use [docker](https://www.docker.com) for a standardized and easy to follow environment setup.

## Product Backlog

Not every item on the backlog is ready to work on. An item can be place in the backlog even if it never gets used.

If a backlog item description is unclear, you can add clearification request to the author asking to clearlify the item by adding `---`, e.g:

```
Add option for user to do some stuff.

---

Which user should be able to do what?
```

## Standards and conventions

- Indentation: 2 tabs / 4 spaces

Additionally, we want to follow popular/common practices and conventions. Sources to those highlighted below are [PHP_FIG - PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [Laravel Best Practices (Repo)](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices#follow-laravel-naming-conventions).
